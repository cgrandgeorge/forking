ingredients:
- 3/4 cup (85 grams) pecans
- 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
- 2 medium-to-large oranges, any variety
- 6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, melted, cooled
- 1/2 to 2/3 cup (120 to 160 grams) sour cream or plain yogurt
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 cups (8 ounces or 225 grams) fresh or frozen cranberries, halved
- 2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour
- Pearl sugar (about 1½ tablespoons), to finish

directions:
- Heat oven to 350°F. If your pecans are untoasted or if they’re labeled toasted but don’t taste very crisp or toasty, toast them now. Place pecans on a small baking sheet in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they smell fragrant. Remove and roughly chop, then set aside.
- Coat a loaf pan (8½ by 4½ or 6-cup volume) with butter or nonstick spray. For easier removal, you can line the bottom and two long sides with a sling of parchment paper.
- Place sugar in a large bowl, and zest oranges into it. Use your fingertips to rub the zest into the sugar, breaking it up a bit and releasing more fragrance.
- Cut oranges in half and juice them into a 1-cup measure; I get between 1/3 and 1/2 cup. Spoon in sour cream until the juice reaches the 1-cup line; whisk to combine.
- Whisk butter and egg into zest-sugar mixture. Whisk in orange juice-sour cream mixture. Sprinkle surface of batter with salt, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk thoroughly into the batter. Scrape the bowl down. Stir in cranberries and pecans. Stir in flour until it just disappears.
- Scrape batter into prepared pan and spread smooth. Sprinkle cake with pearl sugar, if using.
- Bake for 60 to 70 minutes, rotating once for even color, until a toothpick inserted into the loaf comes out batter-free. Give the cake more time if needed; don’t worry about it getting dark. Cool in pan on a rack until lukewarm, or at room temperature. Serve in slices.
